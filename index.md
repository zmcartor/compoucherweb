    PURPOSE is the difference between an accident, and progress.
    At Compoucher, all our happy accidents are on purpose. We
    strive to create authtentic, delightful moments in our products and for
    our clients. Our only success metric is experiences that further real relationships, 
    and enhance the future.

      HUMOR centered design is at the core of what we do. It all starts with
      the people - what delights them? What challenges do they face? Strong
      empathy, and rapid prototyping allows us to create the perfect product
      to their needs. Humor is inside everything we do. We believe that above
      all else, laughter creates communitites. Humor activates our sense of
      wonder, which is where learning begins. Artifical Intelligence hasn't
      even begun to understand jokes. Our best comedians are still people.
