This is a cool place where the article thing could go explaning a little bit of
what compoucher is all about. Maybe use some of the column things to make the
text a little bit more readable. That would be pretty cool. Compoucher is about
creating a releasing humanist experiences through software and digital art.
Well designed software should complement the human condition instead of
alienate us. That's pretty cool I hope this watch thing actually works out!
