This is a cool place where the article thing could go explaning a little bit of
what compoucher is all about. Maybe use some of the column things to make the
text a little bit more readable. That would be pretty cool. Compoucher is about
creating a releasing humanist experiences through software and digital art.
Well designed software should complement the human condition instead of
alienate us. That's pretty cool I hope this watch thing actually works out!

Another article about some really cool stuff and what the deal really is here
and what's going on you know? Can't be too clear about things with software
anymore. Electronic pulses are really cool, what do you think ?
